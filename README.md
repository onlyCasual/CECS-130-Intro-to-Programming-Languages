### Lab 4 ( Calculator Extended )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** Rewrite your [lab 3](CECS%20130%20-%20Lab%20%233.c) calculator program using ***functions***.
Each mathematical operation in the menu should be represented by a ***separate function***. In
addition to all operations your calculator had to support in [lab 3](CECS%20130%20-%20Lab%20%233.c), please add ***additional
functionality to your calculator***. Include the ability to compute the ***factorial of an integer***
*(Example: 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 *4 = 24)*, and an ***integer power of a number*** *(Example: 53 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125)*.
Finally, add an ***interesting mathematical function*** of your choosing which computes the ***first n
numbers of a sequence of numbers*** and ***utilizes an array to store the result*** before displaying it
*(Examples of mathematical sequences: Fibonacci, Primes)*.\
*You program MUST be bug-free, user friendly (verify input from the user), well commented
(Including author information, program description, lab section, date, etc.)*\

### Lab 5 ( Story )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** Write a program which generates ***interactive stories***. You
program should begin by ***asking the user a number of questions*** such as: *what is your name?
How old are you? What is your favorite color? Etc.* After obtaining a sufficient amount of
personal information your program should ***output a short story*** *(at least one paragraph)* which
***incorporates user’s personal information*** you have obtained via questioning. (The topic of the
story is up to you, but please keeps it clean.) The generated story should be somewhat ***different
every time the program is run*** *(randomly generate alternative endings, randomly select different
descriptions of objects (blue car, green car, red car), etc.* Your program should make use of
***pointers*** and ***arrays*** to deal with strings.\
*You program MUST be bug-free, well commented (Including author’s
information, program description, lab section, date, etc.).*\

### Lab 6 ( Phone Book )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** Write a program that uses an ***array of structures*** to hold
contact information for your friends. The program should allow the user to enter as many friends
as the user wants. ***Create functions to add or delete entries*** in the phone book and to ***print valid
phone book entries***. *Do not display phone book entries that are invalid or NULL (0)*. You can
assume that all people have unique names. Make sure you ***allocate*** and ***free memory*** as
necessary.\
*You program MUST be bug-free, well commented (Including author’s
information, program description, lab section, date, etc.).*\

### Lab 7 ( Phone Book Extended )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** Add ***additional functionality*** to your phonebook program
from [lab 6](CECS%20130%20-%20Lab%20%236.c). Make it possible for users to:
1. Alphabetically sort the list of entries by name (first or last).
2. Find a phone number for a given name.
3. Randomly select a friend from the phonebook for you to call.
4. Delete everyone from the phonebook at the same time.

*You program MUST be bug-free, well commented (Including author’s
information, program description, lab section, date, etc.).*\

### Lab 8 ( Phone Book Extended w/ Files )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** You have worked very hard on your phonebook program
for many weeks and it is becoming a popular application with all your friends. You decide you
want to compete with [Facebook](www.facebook.com) and the next upgrade of your phonebook software should
***make contact data accessible even if the user closes your applicatio***n and ***returns to it at a later
time***.\
Add additional functionality to your phonebook program from [lab 7](CECS%20130%20-%20Lab%20%237.c). Make it possible for users
to:
1. Store all entries in the phonebook into a location/file-name specified by the user.
2. Retrieve entries from the location/file-name specified by the user.

*If the user does not explicitly specify a path to the file, a default location of your choosing should
be used. You program MUST be bug-free, well commented (Including author’s
information, program description, lab section, date, etc.).*\

### Lab 9 ( Tic-Tac-Toe )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** In the ***C++*** programming language write a program
capable of ***playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the user***. Your program should use ***OOP concepts*** in its
design. You can use ***ASCII art*** to generate and display the ***3x3*** playing board. *The program
should randomly decide who goes first computer or user. Your program should know and inform
the user if an illegal move was made (cell already occupied).* The program should also ***announce
if one of the players wins or if a draw is achieved***. *While it is desirable for your program to play
a strong game, this is not an Artificial Intelligence course so if your program does not play at a
world champion level you will not be penalized for it.* \
*You program MUST be bug-free, well commented (Including author’s
information, program description, lab section, date, etc.).*\

### Lab 10 ( 3D Tic-Tac-Toe )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** In the ***C++*** programming language write a program
capable of ***playing 3D Tic-Tac-Toe against the user***. Your program should use ***OOP concepts*** in
its design. Use Inheritance to create a derived class from your [lab 9](CECS%20130%20-%20Lab%20%239/) Tic-Tac-Toe class. You
can use ***ASCII art*** to generate and display the ***3x3x3*** playing board. *The program should
randomly decide who goes first computer or user. Your program should know and inform the
user if an illegal move was made (cell already occupied).* The program should also *keep the
score and announce if one of the players wins or if a draw is achieved.* *While it is desirable for
your program to play a strong game, this is not an Artificial Intelligence course so if your
program does not play at a world champion level you will not be penalized for it.*\
*The object of a 3D-TTT is to get as many 3-in-a-row as possible. You win just like in traditional
TTT, except you can also win by getting 3-in-a-raw down each board.* \
*You program MUST be bug-free, well commented (Including author’s
information, program description, lab section, date, etc.).*\
