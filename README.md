# Intro to Programming Languages ( CECS 130 )

### Lab 1 ( ASCII-Art Instructor )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** Write a computer program in ***C*** which will generate an
original ***ASCII-art picture***, more specifically, a representation of your ***instructor Dr.
Yampolskiy***. \
*You program MUST be bug-free, well commented (Including author’s
information, program description, lab section, date, etc.) and must demonstrate use of
different escape sequences.*\

### Lab 2 ( Foreign Currency Exchange )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** Programming assignment (100 pts): Write a computer program in ***C*** which will request
the user to enter a number representing the amount of ***foreign currency*** he/she would
like to exchange. Your program should ***output a foreign currency conversion table*** for at
least ***6*** different currencies, showing how much of each type of foreign currency can be
obtained for the amount the user enters.\
*All exchange rates in your program must be current and coded as constants. Make sure
you display a nice looking table using escape sequences and your ability to produce
beautiful ASCII-art. You program MUST be bug-free and well commented (Including
author information, program description, lab section, date, etc.)*\

### Lab 3 ( Calculator )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** Write a computer program in ***C*** which will ***simulate a
calculator***. Your calculator needs to support the ***five*** basic operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division and modulus) plus ***primality testing*** (natural number is prime if it has no
non-trivial divisors).\
*You program MUST be bug-free, well commented (Including author’s
information, program description, lab section, date, etc.) and must demonstrate use of
different escape sequences.*\

### Lab 4 ( Calculator Extended )
**Programming assignment ( 100 pts ):** Rewrite your [lab 3](CECS%20130%20-%20Lab%20%233.c) calculator program using ***functions***.
Each mathematical operation in the menu should be represented by a ***separate function***. In
addition to all operations your calculator had to support in [lab 3](CECS%20130%20-%20Lab%20%233.c), please add ***additional
functionality to your calculator***. Include the ability to compute the ***factorial of an integer***
*(Example: 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 *4 = 24)*, and an ***integer power of a number*** *(Example: 53 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125)*.
Finally, add an ***interesting mathematical function*** of your choosing which computes the ***first n
numbers of a sequence of numbers*** and ***utilizes an array to store the result*** before displaying it
*(Examples of mathematical sequences: Fibonacci, Primes)*.\
*You program MUST be bug-free, user friendly (verify input from the user), well commented
(Including author information, program description, lab section, date, etc.)*\
